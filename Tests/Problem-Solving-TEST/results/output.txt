QUANTUM CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION
============================================================

Enter the number of qubits for the experiment
Recommended ranges:
  - 8-12 qubits: Fast execution (5-20 minutes)
  - 13-16 qubits: Balanced (20-40 minutes)
  - 17-20 qubits: Enhanced quantum advantage (40-90 minutes)
  - 21-25 qubits: Maximum complexity (90+ minutes)

Note: Higher qubit counts provide better quantum advantage
but require more computational resources and time.

Number of qubits (8-25): 25

You selected 25 qubits.
Estimated total runtime: 90-150 minutes
Proceed with this configuration? (y/n): Y
✓ GPU settings configured for 25-qubit simulation
============================================================
✓ NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK detected!
✓ Using Lightning.GPU for 25-qubit simulation
✓ Expected runtime: 9-15 minutes per maze
============================================================

============================================================
ADAPTIVE QUANTUM MAZE NAVIGATION EXPERIMENT
============================================================

This experiment will configure a Variational Quantum Neural Network
with your specified number of qubits to solve maze navigation tasks.

Higher qubit counts provide:
  • Better quantum advantage and entanglement
  • Richer state representations
  • Potentially higher solution quality
  • Longer runtime due to increased complexity
