QUANTUM MAZE NAVIGATION CONFIGURATION
============================================================

Select maze size for the experiment:

Available configurations:
  1. 3x3 mazes (9 qubits)
     - Compact mazes with 9 cells
     - Fastest execution (~2-6 hours)
     - Good for initial testing

  2. 4x4 mazes (16 qubits)
     - Medium mazes with 16 cells
     - Moderate runtime (~1-3 days)
     - Balanced complexity

  3. 5x5 mazes (25 qubits)
     - Large mazes with 25 cells
     - Longer runtime (~3-5 days)
     - Maximum complexity

Each configuration properly scales both maze size and qubits
Using fixed 3x3 local observation window for all sizes

Enter your choice (1, 2, or 3): 1

SCALABLE QUANTUM MAZE NAVIGATION EXPERIMENT
============================================================

This experiment tests a Variational Quantum Neural Network
with properly scaled maze sizes and qubit allocations.

Each configuration uses:
  â€¢ NÂ² cells for NxN mazes
  â€¢ NÂ² qubits for quantum processing
  â€¢ Fixed 3x3 observation window for consistency

This ensures scientifically valid comparisons across scales.
